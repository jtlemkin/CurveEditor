Hello Alex or Sai!

Compile with the command: 'cmake CMakeLists.txt' and then 'make'

Run the executable (hw4).

On the top left, you will see the text 'inserting' or 'modifying', which indicates whether your mouse click will insert
a new point, or change the position of the current selected point. Press the 'm' key to change modes.

On the bottom left, you will see text indicating whether you are editing B-spline or bezier curves. If in B-spline mode,
you will see additional text such as the the current knot selected, its position, and the order of the curve. Press the
't' key to change curve types.

Click on the screen to create a point! It should appear in blue indicating that the current point is selected. If in
inserting mode, the the next click will insert a point after the current point selected. You can press the left or
right arrow keys to select a different point.

Add as many points as your heart desires. To create a new curve, press the 'n' click and click on the window to create
a new point. You can tell a curve is selcted because it is green and has visible control points.
